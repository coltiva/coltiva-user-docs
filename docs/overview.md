# Overview
## App
The Coltiva app lets you look at recent sensor values, and control pumps.

## How the Coltiva device works
### No Wi-Fi configured
*Indicator light pattern: -----  -----  ----- (on 3s, off 1s)*

The first time the device is used, or after performing a factory reset, the device must be provided with Wi-Fi name (SSID) and password. This is done using the phone app. Log in, press "Connect Coltiva device to Wi-Fi" and follow the instructions.

### No Wi-Fi accessible
If the Wi-Fi which the device has been configured for is not available, e.g. ...
### Normal operation
*Indicator light pattern: ------------ (always on) OR -- -- -- -- -- (on 950 ms, off 50 ms) when measuring*

When the device is connected to a Wi-Fi network with internet access, the device enters normal operation.

In normal operation, the circulation pump (if installed) is normally active. Approximately every 5 minutes, the circulation pump stops and the sensors are sampled. This takes 20-60 seconds. The circulation pump then resumes operation.
