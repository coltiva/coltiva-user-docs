# pH
## Calibrate pH sensor
Frequent calibration of the pH sensor ensure that the measurement values accurately reflect the nutrient solution's acidity. For calibration, two buffer solutions of pH 4 and 7 must be used. For best results, rinse the electrode with deionized or distilled water before immersing it in buffer solution.

## Clean pH sensor
pH sensor cleaning must be done with care. Normally, rinsing it with a commercial pH probe storage/cleaning solution, or pH 4 buffer, is enough. If the electrode is not sufficiently cleaned this way, let it soak for an extended period of time in the cleaning solution.

**Avoid** touching the glass electrode of the sensor with any object. Soft objects like cloths and cotton swabs risk transferring static charges to the pH electrode, which will degrade its performance. Other parts of the sensor may be cleaned with a soft cloth.
