# Pumps

Coltiva can control up to eight pumps. The pumps can be used for multiple purposes. The seven pump outlets numbered 1-7 are for pumps that run on request. These can be used to, for example:
* Refill the reservoir with
  * nutrients
  * pure water
  * pH adjustment
  * other additives
* Empty the reservoir

Additionally, there's one outlet labelled "circ pump", which is intended for a circulation pump (for small reservoirs). The circulation pump runs all the time, except for when:
* Another pump is running
* Sensor reading is ongoing

The pumps have a minimum dosage volume of **200 ml**. If 200 ml is more than you want to add (e.g. for pH adjustment liquids and concentrated nutrients), dilute your solution so that 200 ml of the diluted solution corresponds to the minimum amount you want to be able to pump.

## Avoiding siphoning
It is very important to not mount the end of a refill or drain pump's hose lower than the water level of the tank that it is pumping from. This causes the refill liquid to continue flowing into the reservoir, even after the pump has been shut off.

Instead, place the refill tanks so that the end of the refill hose is higher than the liquid level in the refill tank.

Alternatively, if it is not possible to have the refill tank's liquid level lower than the hose end, you can prevent siphoning by allowing for pressure equalization. Install a T-connector at the highest point of the hose, and attach a piece of hose with the other end open. Attach the open hose end at least 1 m above the T-connector.

It is equally important to not let the end of the refill hose be submerged in the reservoir solution. This can lead to backwards siphoning, meaning that the reservoir liquid flows backwards into the refill tank.

## Mounting

The pumps may be mounted with magnets (easier to attach/detach and usually more reliable) or suction cups.


### Mounting with magnets
To mount using magnets, your pump platform must be equipped with magnets.

1. **Position the magnets**
    
    Attach the magnets that you're going to mount to the pump platform magnets. The magnetic force will hold them firmly in place, and make sure that the magnets that you're mounting are mounted with the correct layout.

2. **Prepare the surface**
    
    The surface to which you're attaching the magnets must be prepared for maximum adhesion. Please see [Preparing surfaces for gluing or taping](./preparing-surfaces-for-gluing-or-taping.mdx).
