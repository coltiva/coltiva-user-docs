# Connect Coltiva to Wi-Fi (provisioning)

## Overview

When the device is started the first time, you must provide the device with your Wi-Fi network's name (SSID) and password.

Before the device has been configured to connect to your Wi-Fi network, it will turn itself into a Wi-Fi access point. This is so you can connect your phone directly to the Coltiva device, and transfer your Wi-Fi network's name and password.

## Detailed instructions

1. Open the Coltiva app on your phone.
2. Sign up, or log in if you already have an account.
3. If your account is configured, you will see a button _Connect Coltiva device to Wi-Fi_. Click the button.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to temporarily leave the app and use Wi-Fi on your phone to connect to the device (Wi-Fi name **COLTIVA_XXX**).

## Reconfigure Wi-Fi (connect to a new network)

If you need to connect to a new Wi-Fi network, or if your network has changed name or password, you must first reset the Coltiva device so that you can provision it again. Do this by holding the "factory reset" button for approximately 3 seconds, until the indicator light flashes quickly a few times. Then, proceed with provisioning according to the instructions above. **Do not hold the factory reset button longer than needed. This will cause the device to fully reset to factory settings, losing software updates and sensor calibration.**
