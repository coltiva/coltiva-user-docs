# Set up supply tank

A pump must be mounted to the bottom of the intended supply tank. It may be mounted with magnets (recommended) or suction cups.


## Mounting with magnets
To mount using magnets, your pump platform must be equipped with magnets.

1. **Position the magnets**
    
    Attach the magnets that you're going to mount to the pump platform magnets. The magnetic force will hold them firmly in place, and make sure that the magnets that you're mounting are mounted with the correct layout.

2. **Prepare the surface**
    The surface to which you're attaching the magnets must be prepared for maximum adhesion. Please see [Preparing surfaces for gluing or taping](../preparing-surfaces-for-gluing-or-taping).
