# Set up reservoir


## Installation

Let's setup your Coltiva device.

1. **Mount water level sensor (read before filling up your reservoir!)**

    See how to mount the water level sensor on the [water level sensor page](../sensors/level.md).

2. **Mount device**

    Use the supplied bracket to attach the Coltiva device in a suitable location. Take into consideration the cable lengths of the sensors in the tank, the water level sensor, and the refill tanks.

    The bracket can either be attached with double-sided tape, or with screws. If you want to attach it with double-sided tape, please see the page on [how to prepare surfaces for taping](../preparing-surfaces-for-gluing-or-taping.mdx).

3. **Mount the in-reservoir sensors**

    The sensors for pH, EC and water temperature must be placed inside the reservoir. Use the supplied platform to attach the sensors. The platform can be mounted using magnets or suction cups.

4. **Mount drain pump**

    If you intend to use a drain pump, this should be mounted to the bottom of the reservoir. Please refer to the instructions on the [pumps page](../pumps.mdx).
