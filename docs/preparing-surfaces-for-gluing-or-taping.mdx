# Preparing surfaces for gluing or taping
Before attaching magnets, sensors or the device bracket with glue or double-sided tape, it is essential to prepare the surfaces correctly to achieve good adhesion.

1. **Choose mounting location**
    
    Ensure that the component you're mounting has sufficient space and is in a convenient position.

2. **Abrade the surface(s)**
   
    Sand the surface using medium-grit sandpaper (120-180 grit). This mechanical surface preparation increases adhesion by creating a larger contact area. If you're gluing, abrade both surfaces.

3. **Clean the surface**
    
    Use a solvent which doesn't leave any residue behind, e.g. denatured alcohol. Make sure the solvent does not damage the surface you're preparing. If you're gluing, clean both surfaces.

4. **Done**

    Go ahead and mount your component!
